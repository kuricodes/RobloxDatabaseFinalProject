this script is placed inside the delete button of the base data entry object.
whenever a new data entry gui object is created by the main script, this subscript
will automatically run, linking the delete button to the main script.

I have chosen to do it like this for the sake of my own convenience- I technically
could have the main script automatically create and remove events bound to each
entry gui's delete button, but every time they are deleted I would have to also
manually root through prior code to get the event and unbind it.
If i failed at this, it would cause a memory leak.

This solution, however, is easier for me and has no negative effects in my code.
