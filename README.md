# Roblox Database Final Project
The fully assembled project file is included.
Each script has instructions on where it goes, but given how heavily this project revolves around the GUI, it would be a far better use of your time to just download the full project file.
# There is a working version already available online for you
just head over here:

# in case you still want to open the project file
In order to open the project file, you just have to download Roblox Studio and use it to open the file.

the project file requires datastore access in studio in order to save changes you've made.

in order to get saving to work, you must take the following steps:

1) publish the project to roblox using the file dropdown menu in the top left

2) navigate to the published experience on the roblox website (typically through inventory -> places -> created by me)

3) click the three dots icon next to the experience's name, then click "configure this experience"

4) enable the checkbox that says "enable studio access to api services"

5) hit "save changes"

then everything should work.
